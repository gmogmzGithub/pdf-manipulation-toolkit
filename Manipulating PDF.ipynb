       "'IS BUSINESS SCHOOL RIGHT FOR Y OU?  \\nG\\nraduates of MBA programs can be found in almost any type of organization. Business school will \\nprepare you to create or lead an organization, manage resources, develop effective operational \\nstrategies, and more. Once admitted, r equired coursework typically include s: Organizational \\nBehavior, Marketing, Accounting, Finance, Strategy, and Operations Management. This is followed \\nby elective coursework that allows the student to customize their experience. Some students consider an MBA as essential for advancement to a management role while others will use it as a means to change careers. As an undergraduate student, it is unlikely that you will be admitted to enter directly into an MBA program without first working for a few years. This period of employment will give you time to think about your long term goals and help you determine if a graduate degree is appropriate.  \\nI\\nnformational meetings  \\nTalking with  people (with or without MBAs) currently working in  field s that inter est you  can be \\nextremely helpful as you consider your future career options.  \\nB\\ne sure to ask:  \\n•How is an MBA viewed by the industry?\\n•Will an MBA improve your chances of being hired and moving ahead ?\\n•If that person has an MBA, ask about their experience in the program they attended\\n•What was most helpful for you as you prepared your application?\\nYour conversation can help you put into context how applicable the program will be to your career goals. Also, speak with current students or those who have recently completed an MBA program. \\nInquire about their experience in the program and how it has i mpact ed their careers. \\nWh\\nat should you do to prepare for business school?  \\nThere’s no magic formula for  the perfect undergraduate conce ntration , set of academic \\nachievements, pre -MBA work experience, extracurricular accomplishments, essays, interviews, or \\nrecommendations. Nor is there a common career goal or industry in which you can aspire to work. What MBAs have in common is they find opportunities to take initiative, they are motivated, have a strong awareness of themselves, and have a desire to learn and grow.   \\nB\\nusiness schools tend to focus on impact \\nmore than scale. Make sure, therefore, that the academic and extracurricular choices you make truly reflect your interests, demonstrate initiative, and give you opportunities to play a leadership role in the organization. A strong undergraduate academic record and GMAT (or possibly GRE) score are  also  important parts of your a pplication to business school. Many schools \\nallow you to sit in on a class to gain insight into what a typical course looks like. Take advantage of this opportunity!  Business schools look for leaders. In \\nwhat ways have you demonstrated \\ninitiative or translated a vision into a reality? Bear in mind that it’s not about the size of your accomplishment, but the \\npassion with which you invest in and \\npursue your goals. '"

       " 'IS BUSINESS SCHOOL RIGHT FOR Y OU?  \\nG\\nraduates of MBA programs can be found in almost any type of organization. Business school will \\nprepare you to create or lead an organization, manage resources, develop effective operational \\nstrategies, and more. Once admitted, r equired coursework typically include s: Organizational \\nBehavior, Marketing, Accounting, Finance, Strategy, and Operations Management. This is followed \\nby elective coursework that allows the student to customize their experience. Some students consider an MBA as essential for advancement to a management role while others will use it as a means to change careers. As an undergraduate student, it is unlikely that you will be admitted to enter directly into an MBA program without first working for a few years. This period of employment will give you time to think about your long term goals and help you determine if a graduate degree is appropriate.  \\nI\\nnformational meetings  \\nTalking with  people (with or without MBAs) currently working in  field s that inter est you  can be \\nextremely helpful as you consider your future career options.  \\nB\\ne sure to ask:  \\n•How is an MBA viewed by the industry?\\n•Will an MBA improve your chances of being hired and moving ahead ?\\n•If that person has an MBA, ask about their experience in the program they attended\\n•What was most helpful for you as you prepared your application?\\nYour conversation can help you put into context how applicable the program will be to your career goals. Also, speak with current students or those who have recently completed an MBA program. \\nInquire about their experience in the program and how it has i mpact ed their careers. \\nWh\\nat should you do to prepare for business school?  \\nThere’s no magic formula for  the perfect undergraduate conce ntration , set of academic \\nachievements, pre -MBA work experience, extracurricular accomplishments, essays, interviews, or \\nrecommendations. Nor is there a common career goal or industry in which you can aspire to work. What MBAs have in common is they find opportunities to take initiative, they are motivated, have a strong awareness of themselves, and have a desire to learn and grow.   \\nB\\nusiness schools tend to focus on impact \\nmore than scale. Make sure, therefore, that the academic and extracurricular choices you make truly reflect your interests, demonstrate initiative, and give you opportunities to play a leadership role in the organization. A strong undergraduate academic record and GMAT (or possibly GRE) score are  also  important parts of your a pplication to business school. Many schools \\nallow you to sit in on a class to gain insight into what a typical course looks like. Take advantage of this opportunity!  Business schools look for leaders. In \\nwhat ways have you demonstrated \\ninitiative or translated a vision into a reality? Bear in mind that it’s not about the size of your accomplishment, but the \\npassion with which you invest in and \\npursue your goals. ',\n",
       " '  \\n \\nWhat can you do during the summer? \\nSummers provide you with opportunities to enhance the skills you’ll most likely want to use in your \\nwork, to explore various  industry options, and build your professional network. As with your \\nacademic and extracurricular choices, anything you do in the summer that adds value to your \\ncredibility as a leader or someone with a strong sense of i nitiative will be useful to your candidacy \\nfor business school. That can be anything from starting a swim ming  program to teaching ESL.  \\n \\n \\nWHEN TO APPLY?  \\n \\nRegular admissions   \\nMost undergraduates typically work for at least two years before applying to an MBA program.  \\nMany decide to apply only after knowing : \\n1. That they have had enough career experience and insight to set practical goals , and \\n2. How their MBA investment would pay of f personally and professionally.  \\nBusiness  schools do not favor one industry over another for work experience, so look for \\nopportunities in an area that most interests you , and  where you can demonstrate accomplishment \\nand leadership in that field.  \\n \\nHBS 2+2 is a deferred admissions program  that is unique to the Harvard Business School. You will \\napply in  the spring of  your senior year . If you are admitted, you are expected to work for  at least  \\ntwo years prior to matriculation at HBS.  Please see the HBS 2+2 website ( www.hbs.edu/2+2 ) for \\nthe most up -to-date application information and deadlines. Other schools including Yale and \\nStan ford also have programs that allow you to apply as an undergraduate (though each program \\nhas a unique structure and requirements).  \\n \\n \\n \\nTIP:  CONSULT THE OFFICIAL GMAT®  WEB SITE  at http://www.mba.com , which offers \\nexcellent advice about everything from evaluating business school as an option to your overall \\napplication strategy.  \\n \\n \\nJoint -degree programs   \\nA joint or dual degree program is a full -time MBA program that is combined with another full -time \\ngraduate program of study , such as : \\n \\n• law  \\n• medicine  \\n• healthcare administration  \\n• engineering  • technology  \\n• international studies  \\n• public policy  \\n• dentistry \\n \\nYou  must apply separately for each program. While  both programs are usually at the same school, \\nsome cooperative relationships between schools do exist. The second program determines total \\nprogram length, but joint degrees generally t ake three to four years to complete.  \\n ',\n",
       " 'Advantages  \\n• Joint degree programs are most attractive to indivi duals who want to work at the \\nintersection of both professions . For example, an aspiring healthcare entrepreneur may \\nseek a joint degree for a career developing new healthcare resources or managing a \\nhealthcare organization.  \\n• Students who want to make a career transition may like the fact that the joint or dual \\ndegree option allows them to earn two degrees faster than if they pursued the degrees \\nseparately, because some courses will fulfill requirements in both programs.  \\n \\nLimitations \\n• Joint degrees require an extensive absence from the job market —usually three or more \\nyears.  Therefore, this may not be the best choice for those who plan to continue along a \\ncareer path and need to maintain current job skills and professional knowledge.  \\n• Prospective employers may not have a clear understanding of why you chose to pursue \\neither or  both disciplines.  \\n \\n \\nWHAT IS THE APPLICAT ION PROCESS?  \\n \\nTimeline  \\nMost US business schools have three rounds of admissions deadlines : \\n• fall (September/October)  \\n• winter (January/February)  \\n• spring (March/April)  \\nCheck each school’s admissions schedule . When a deadline arrives, the admissions committee \\nreviews all complet ed applications submitted by the deadline. All subsequent applications are held \\nuntil the next deadline, or “round.”  Some business schools operate on a “rolling” calendar, \\nreview ing applications as they arrive and continu ing to admit students until all spaces have been \\nfilled.  \\n \\n \\nResearching programs and schools  \\nThere are over 1900 business schools offering more than 4500 programs worldwide. Try \\nthese resources to help narrow the field:  \\n \\n• www.mba.com  The Graduate Management Admission Search Service® (GMASS®) \\ndeveloped by the Graduate Management Admissions Council. When you create an \\naccount on mba.com or when you take the GMAT exam, you’ll be asked if you want \\nbusiness schools to contact you. If you ch oose \"yes,\" then your information will be \\nentered into the GMASS search service database, so schools can find you.  \\n• www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/business- school   Tools on the OCS website to help you \\nevaluate MBA programs.  \\n• https://www.usnews.com/best -graduate- schools  U.S. News and World Report  \\nannual ranking of MBA programs . \\n ',\n",
       " \"School rankings  \\nOver the years, the media and MBA  program brochures have elevated the significance of business \\nschool rankings as one of the most important benchmarks for choosing a school to attend. However, \\nschool rankings often depend on which publication you read and what research methodology was \\nused. In some cases, information is subjective and may include results that are not checked for \\naccuracy. Most importantly, rankings do not take into account the unique elements of certain \\nprograms and how these attributes might meet your individual needs. Rankings tell you what \\nschools are “best” but do not take into account “best fit.”  \\n  \\nAdmissions testing  \\nMost MBA programs require at least one graduate admissions test score.  \\n• www.mba.com  Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT®) \\n• www.ets.org  Graduate Record Exam inations  (GRE)  \\nConsult the individual school website for requirements. Many graduating seniors complete their \\ngraduate school admissions test during their senior year when they are most comfortable with \\ntesting and have the flexibility to adequately prepare. Most applica nts prepare on their own using \\none of the test -preparation publications available at most bookstores or on the test website.  \\n \\nEssays and personal statements  \\nMost business schools require one or more essays in their application.  Essay prompts may include \\na range of subjects such as leadership, long -term career goals, professional accomplishments , and \\ncommunity engagement . When preparing your essays, make sure that together they tell one story.  \\nYou, as the candidate,  are the story. Your essays should refle ct different aspects of your character, \\naccomplishments and aspirations that will allow the admissions committee to know you better.  \\n \\n• Write to express, not impress.  Admissions professionals can tell when you’re  just writ ing \\nwhat you think they want to read . If you’ve done your homework, you know why you want \\nan MBA degree and how that fits into your overall career game plan.  \\n• What will you bring to the classroom? Being part of a business school community is a \\ngive- and-take proposition. It’s not only about what you can gain from business school, it’s \\nalso about what you’re willing to share. Candidates are often judged by what value they can \\nbring to the classroom a nd the community experience , in addition to  how well they match \\nentrance requirements.  \\n• Why this school?  Much like applying for a job, know why you want to pursue an MBA at a \\nparticular school or program. Show that you are familiar with the given school and why you \\nare a good fit.  \\n• Reality check: Is this the right time for you?  You’re going to business school to advance \\nyour career, right? Your job success as an MBA graduate may rely to a large extent on what \\nyou did beforehand. Find out what MBA employers l ook for in candidates by talking to \\nstudents, alumni and the school’s career services office. If you don't have enough experience \\nright now to benefit fully from an MBA, further define your goals and apply later.  \\n \",\n",
       " 'Letters of r ecommendation   \\nA recommendati on letter needs to : \\n1. Support how well you can manage the academic demands of the MBA program and your \\npotential to succeed in your chosen career . \\n2. Validate or expand on your credentials, strengths, and aspirations . \\n3. Help the admissions office to get an overall sense  of you as a  candidate.  \\n \\nChoose a good cross -sect ion of people who can attest to your dependability and who know about \\nyour plans for MBA study, such as employers, colleagues, and faculty. Schools may have different \\nrecommendation requirement s. Check with each school you are applying to before you select your \\nrecommender s. Each program requires a specific number of recommendation letters, usually two \\nor three. Don’t exceed that number without prior agreement from the admissions staff . \\nRecommendations are valuable only if they reflect relevant professional skills. Avoid getting letters \\nfrom people with important -sounding job titles who do not know you or your work.   \\n \\nResume   \\nThere is not a special format for your resume when applying to business  school. Use the OCS \\nresume templates on the OCS website as your guideline. Make sure to emphasize your leadership \\nexperience as well as your analytical and quantitative aptitude.  \\n \\nInterviews  \\nMany schools conduct admissions interviews  and most offer advic e about how to prepare on their \\nAdmissions website. Each program varies in format and location of the interview. Generally, an \\nadmissions interview provides an opportunity for you to review your accomplishments relative to \\nyour interest in the program.  \\n \\nFinancial aid \\nYou can find information about determining the “real cost” of your MBA as well as financial aid \\nresources at the official GMAT website at www.mba.com .  In general, financial aid may be available \\nto you thr ough grants and scholarships, loans,  and Federal Work Study. In some cases, pre -MBA \\nemployers may offer to re -pay all or a portion of the cost of your program once you return to work \\nfor them. T otal costs including tuition, room/board , and fees can range from $90,000 to over \\n$110,000 per year.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  ',\n",
